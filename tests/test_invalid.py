"""
Mutation test gate for Windows using `mutatest` and `pytest`.
- Runs coverage first (via pytest + coverage) and enforces a minimum threshold.
- Then runs `mutatest` and parses results to compute a mutation score.
- Fails the process (exit code 1) if the mutation score is below MIN_SCORE or if there are survivors
  when score parsing is unavailable but survivors are detected in the textual output.

Notes for Windows compatibility:
- Executables are invoked as Python modules using `sys.executable -m <module>` to avoid PATH issues.
- All file writes go under a local `Logs/` folder.
- Output parsing is resilient to small format changes; if exact numbers cannot be parsed, it falls back
  to detecting "SURVIVED" lines and failing accordingly.

Comments are in English and there are no emojis by request.
